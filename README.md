Collection of shell scripts and other stuff i've made over the years.

motd.filler.sh --> Script generates custom welcome / motd message for my FreeBSD servers, displayed after initial login. It's not a real motd file though. Since it runs after the shell is run.. does the trick though.
Combination of printf formatting to create tables and a couple of color-set sequence definitions for those disco moments.

remote_include.editor.sh -->
